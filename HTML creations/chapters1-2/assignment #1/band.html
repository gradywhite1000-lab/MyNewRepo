    <h2>Favorite CD Releases & Reviews</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>The New Abnormal</dt>
        <dd>Personally my favorite album by the alternative masterminds. Produced by legendary sound engineer
        Rick Rubin, it features a blend of their classic sound with a new twist, highlighting their creativity</dd>
        <dt>First Impressions of Earth</dt>
        <dd>For me this album is their most dark sounding studio creation. Not a bad thing the guitars really
        standout and take the lead for the sound as a whole.</dd>
        <dt>Angles</dt>
        <dd>A more intresting spin in sound they've done. More bright and catchy tunes. Some of my favorites are
        Under Cover of Darkness and Taken for a Fool.</dd>
