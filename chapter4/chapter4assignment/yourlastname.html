        <h2 class="dotted-headline">About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a 23-year-old veteran with a passion for the outdoors and technology. 
            My military experience taught me discipline and the value of teamwork, skills I 
            apply to every aspect of my life. I love discovering new animals, and learning about them.
        </p>

        <h2 class="dotted-headline">Hobbies & Activities</h2>
        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy fishing, hiking, and camping. I find being out on the
            water or in the woods to be a great way to relax and socially detox from the noise of life.
